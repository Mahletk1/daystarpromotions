            <p>With prayerful consideration and after 5 award winning years with Southern
              Gospel super group, the Gaither Vocal Band, lead vocalist Michael English has
              decided to step away from the group to pursue other opportunities.</p>
            <p>English says, &quot;It was difficult to juggle two careers and I needed
              more time at home... off the road.&quot;</p>
            <p>This move will give Michael more time to dedicate to his solo tour, sharing
              his testimony, and recording and producing with other artists as well.</p>
            <p>&quot;The last 5 years with the GVB have been very enjoyable for me and I
              will miss the guys. This was a very difficult decision but one I feel at peace
              with. It will be a new day for Michael English but one I am very excited
              about. Hope to see many of you at solo shows in the future!&quot;</p>

          <p>Steve
            Ladd is excited to get back into the studio after 2 years but needs our help
            in funding the project.&nbsp; Many of you have asked for new music, and as you
            can imagine, recording is a very expensive process. Studio time, musicians,
            packaging, etc. cost a lot of money, and being an independent artist, that
            burden falls on Steve, as well as his family.&nbsp; To learn more details,
            visit <a href="">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1836791455/new-music-from-steve-ladd</a>.&nbsp;
            Steve goes over what funding needs to be raised and its purpose.&nbsp; As well
            as exciting rewards you can get for helping out.&nbsp; Update:&nbsp; this was
            successfully funded!</p>
